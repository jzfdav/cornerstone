# 🏗️ Cornerstone

> **⚠️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION** — This project is actively being developed and is not yet feature-complete.

**A private, family-only Progressive Web App for home construction tracking.**

## Philosophy

Cornerstone is inspired by Christian principles of:
- **Stewardship** — Managing resources wisely and with care

- **Unity** — Keeping family members aligned
- **Order** — Ensuring transparency and accountability
